I love starting a project and bringing it to the finish line. One of my weaknesses is passing off my hard work to someone that might possibly not take the care and attention that I have. I take massive pride in my work. I say this to describe the scope of this project/paper.

## Headless Commerce with Shopify

I wanted to create a custom designed store in React, MAUI, and React Native. The first designed solution is for the entertainment industry--my first passion. The project is structured as follows.

- Shopify Backend
- Headless Front End
- Custom Applications
- Containerized Backend and Front End Architecture
- Graphic Design
	- Mockups
	- Animations
	- Player Design
	- Marketing

This project aims to create a business-in-a-box where artists, bands, comedians, and labels can create full-feature webstores and sites with minimal effort. The variations of the templates and application offers makes ICONIC a formidable asset.
