# Color.css

Color.css is more than just our css file for the library. It contains color styles of many different styles
to create a collection of seemingly infinite colors to choose from.

## Multiple Class Naming Conventions

We support the use of multiple naming conventions within our library. Whether you like component classes or utility classes,
our library is fit to your preferences.

```html
    <p
        class="text:color blue-300"
    >
    </p>

    <!-- or using all colon -->
    <p
        class="text:color:blue-300"
    >
    </p>
```

1. Background `bg:`
